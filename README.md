# Typescript
This repo will contain TypeScript definition & examples where you might see my skills around this tool!

## Type annotations
Code we add to tell TypeScript what type of value a variable will refer to.

## Type inference
TypeScript tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to.

## Types
The types in TypeScript are classified in two groups:

### Primitive types
- number
- boolean
- void
- undefined
- string
- symbol
- null

# Object types
- functions
- classes 
- arrays
- objects
